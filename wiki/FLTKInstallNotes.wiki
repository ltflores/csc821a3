= FLTK Cmake compiler options =

When running the project through CMake, I find that the
following options must be set (I left my definitions for reference):

{{{
//ITK directory (folder with ITKConfig.cmake)
ITK_DIR:PATH=/home/ltflores/ITK-build/debug/

//Path to a library.
FLTK_BASE_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/home/ltflores/FLTK-build/lib/libfltk.a

//Path to a program.
FLTK_CONFIG_SCRIPT:FILEPATH=/home/ltflores/FLTK-build/fltk-config

//The directory containing FLTKConfig.cmake.  This is either the
// root of the build tree, or PREFIX/lib/fltk for an installation.
FLTK_DIR:PATH=/home/ltflores/FLTK-build/

//Path to a program.
FLTK_FLUID_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/home/ltflores/FLTK-build/bin/fluid

//Path to a library.

//Path to a library.
FLTK_GL_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/home/ltflores/FLTK-build/lib/libfltk_gl.a

//Path to a library.
FLTK_IMAGES_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/home/ltflores/FLTK-build/lib/libfltk_images.a

//Path to a file. (path to original source, if not set you won't see
errors till you try importing into eclipse)
FLTK_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/home/ltflores/Downloads/fltk-1.3.x-r8441
}}}
